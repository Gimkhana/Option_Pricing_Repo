### MONIA Forward Rate Curve Construction

Development of forward rate model for Moroccan interbank market (MONIA) to support Bank Al-Maghrib's LIBOR transition framework.

**Insights**:
- Construction of the forward yield curve using alternative reference rates has not seen the light of day at no central bank until now (as of July 2021).
- Paradigm shift in methodology: from a declarative-based rate to an eﬀective-based rate.
- Moroccan market limited in terms of maturity.
- Limiting assumption: the rate is diﬃcult to model for maturities of more than one year.
- The 12-month rate explodes despite its risk-free nature.
- Impact of Covid-19 on results.
- Research work at a germinal stage.

**Technologies**: Microsoft Excel 
**Methods**: Compounding in arrears, forward rate calculations, sensitivity analysis  
**Data**: MONIA repo rates (2020-2021, Bank Al-Maghrib)
