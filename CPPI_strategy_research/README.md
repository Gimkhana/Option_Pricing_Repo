### CPPI vs. OBPI Portfolio Insurance Strategies

Monte Carlo simulation comparing Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) and Option-Based Portfolio Insurance (OBPI) under Black-Scholes and Lévy jump-diffusion models.

**Insights**:
- The US 10-year Treasury bill yield averaged across the period analysed had a level close to 2.15% and a volatility in terms of yield level of 0.07%.
- The S&P 500 index stayed on average at a level close to 2742.69 and returned on average 11.22% with a volatility of 17.83%.
- During the same time frame, there was a -0.023 correlation coeﬃcientbetween the performance asset and the risk-free asset. This shows that having both assets in an investment portfolio could help diversify it.
- Lévy process shows times of abrupt increases or declines in portfolio value in contrast to the Black-Scholes model. These spikes may result from the model’s capacity to account for both minor and major moves, which aren’t always predicted by historical volatility or price trends.
- In contrast, these jumps are not taken into consideration by the Black-Scholes model. Its reliance on a lognormal price distribution undervalues the likelihood of signiﬁcant price ﬂuctuations, which may lead to a smoother curve but also understate risk.
